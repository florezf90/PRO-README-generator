  # About

With the intention of practicing Basic NODE.JS skill while leveraging value to the community, this is a command-line application that dynamically generates a `README.md` file based on input about your project, allowing developers to save time and energy.

Every README generated by this app, will include quality information about your project, such as:

* What the app is for

* How to use and install it

* How to report issues

* How to make contributions so that other developers are more likely to use and contribute to the success of the project.

      node index.js
   
  It  will prompt from the command line the required inputs to personalize the README, once all of those are answered, the README file will be named 'ExampleREADME.md' and will be ready to use at the root of the repo based on the information provided.
